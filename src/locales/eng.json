      "second-section": "Gender equality is an important dimension of social development because it reflects the level of respect for human rights and points to the roots of discrimination. Gender analysis for Serbia shows that despite the progress, gender inequalities continue to exist. The multi-faceted phenomenon of gender inequality include the domains of labor, money, time, knowledge, health and power according to Gender Equality Index for the Republic of Serbia. There is a dichotomy in the field of paid and unpaid work when it comes to care for children and other household members, as well as dichotomy of work and leisure time. The lack of support to women for attaining balance between work and family life has a great impact on other areas of gender (in) equality in Serbia.",

Slavica Djukic Dejanovic talks about the current situation regarding the coronavirus, how we can help ourselves and others, whether there are some positive things we can connect with the COVID-19 pandemic, but also about harmonizing work and parenthood and the level of health literacy. In January 2020, the Cabinet of the Minister without Portfolio in charge of Demography and Population Policy, in cooperation with the Ana and Vlade Divac Foundation, started the realization of the project 'EQUAL - Towards Gender Equality by Reconciling Work and Family Life of Employees'. The project will be implemented until June 2021, with the financial support of the European Union, through the program 'Rights, Equality and Citizenship (2014-2020)', to establish a balance between work and family life, promotion of gender equality and health literacy of our citizens.",
    "p2": "1. Current recommendations to stay, work and learn from home to reduce the possibility of getting coronavirus can affect the change in family dynamics. Parents may be able to balance business and home obligations a little better, but did we think about balancing of work and parenthood before self-isolation?",
    "p3": "The recommendations of experts that are in force in our country are aimed at reducing social interactions and social distancing, all for the protection of general health of our population, with special reference to our senior citizens. On the other hand, this approach to efforts to slow down and consequently stop the spread of the coronavirus has brought many families whose members now spend more time together, which in some households has affected changes in family dynamics and established habits. This is especially true for our youngest because their dynamic of life is also changing. They have been moved from school environment to their homes to learn using new technologies, so they must have the support of their loved ones. ",
    "p4": "I am especially pleased with the fact that a large number of employers met the needs of their employees and adopted the recommendation of the Government of the Republic of Serbia to enable parents of children up to 12 years of age to work from home. This is one of the possibilities that the Labor Law provides, when of course, working conditions allow it, and that is something that neither employers nor employees were sufficiently informed in the usual circumstances. The cabinet I’m leading has, in partnership with the Serbian Chamber of Commerce and the Republic Bureau of Statistics, surveyed the harmonization of work and parenthood. We have gathered information about the problems that employed parents face every day trying to balance their work and family obligations, but also the attitudes of employers about their readiness to provide support to employed parents. The results of this study also helped to establish the 'Family Friend' award, which recognizes companies that have affirmative measures towards balancing work and parenthood. A step further in that direction is our current project 'Equal', which we launched earlier this year in cooperation with the Ana and Vlade Divac Foundation, with the financial support of the European Union, through the program 'Rights, Equality and Citizenship (2014 -2020). ' Our goal in the next 18 months is to help strengthen the partnership between employees and employers, to inform our citizens about the rights and obligations in the field of labor and employment, with special emphasis on women, given that in our country, unfortunately, stereotypes still prevail when the role of women in family life are in question.",
    "p5": "2. The world pandemic has many victims and it caused great financial losses. However, are there any good things we can associate with the coronavirus pandemic?",
    "p6": "Every medal has two sides, so does this one. The fact that there is a large number of patients in our country and the world is worrying, and that this contagious disease has taken a many lives so far. Looking through the eyes of an optimist, I am pleased with the fact that more and more reports from cities and municipalities across our country show that people are complying to the recommendations of hygienic and anti-epidemic measures. This pandemic is an opportunity to raise health literacy in general population to a much higher level, as well as to work on the promotion and protection of health and healthy lifestyles. Health literacy is not only a trait of the individual but also a key determinant of the health of the population. We learn something new every day, and for all of us, this epidemic is one big lesson that with assessments and recommendations of experts, we can break many misconceptions that can be fatal in some cases. ",
    "p7": "3. On what level is health literacy in Serbia, especially in the current situation when it is necessary to avoid physical contact and to wash our hands as often as possible?",
    "p8": "Despite economic and social progress, low levels of health literacy remain a significant problem in many countries, not just here. Worldwide, more than a third of the population faces a problem of accessing information regarding health, how to understand and apply that information. In addition to all the efforts of the health system and state bodies to convey clear information about medical risks, the greatest responsibility lies with the individual and his/her behavior. In light of the current situation, these actions imply understanding of the mechanism of infectious disease, social and physical distancing and hand washing. ",
    "p9": "The need to comply with the prescribed physical distance is reflected in the knowledge of the way the infectious disease spreads, through small and invisible drops of mucus from the nose and mouth of an infected person, which reach a range of one to two meters when released into the environment. By respecting this epidemiological fact, an understanding of the mechanism of disease development is achieved. Regarding the hygienic habits of our population, the data from the research on health of population of the Republic of Serbia is worrying. It shows that 35% of respondents do not wash their hands regularly after entering the house, before eating and after using the toilet. Raising the level of health literacy is our second task within the project 'Equal'. It is important to point out that by building health literacy skills in everyday life, from understanding information on food packaging and medical advice on health to the need to wash hands as often as possible and reduce contact between people during the coronavirus epidemic, we can significantly reduce the risk of disease and spread. That is why we must understand that we all play in the same team to overcome this vicious disease, and the only way is for everyone to distance themselves from each other in that physical sense during the state of emergency.",
    "p10": "4. You say that it is important that we physically distance ourselves, but some citizens now need our help more than ever. Does the time of the pandemic put solidarity to the test?",
    "p11": "The pandemic caused by the coronavirus has once again proved the indivisible spirit of our people, which has always been in solidarity, especially in times when it was most needed. It is encouraging that many employers have responded to the call to keep their workers on payrolls, despite the reduced workload in certain industries. The opportunity given to parents to work from home is one of the issues that the Cabinet monitors and which it will continue to promote in partnership with Ana and Vlade Divac Foundation through the 'Equal” project. On the other hand, we should not forget about intergenerational cooperation and solidarity, which these days proves that the connection between older and younger citizens is unbreakable. A huge number of young volunteers who help our elderly citizens and make their lives easier break the stereotypes about the lack of tolerance among people of different ages and the lack of interest of generations for each other. Today, Serbia shows its solidarity and how only with collective care we can raise the entire society to a higher level, and that is something that makes me personally extremely proud and happy.",
    "p12": "5. Measures of social distancing also affect mental health. Do you have a recommendation on how we can help ourselves or others in cases of panic, anxiety, or other mental health problems caused by self-isolation or prolonged stay at home?",
    "p13": "As a psychiatrist, I understand the need to maintain mental health, which is just as important as physical health. Measures of social distancing are difficult, but they are necessary at this moment, and an increasing number of people may feel discomfort or panic due to the new situation. It is important to plan and structure your day and fulfill it with various obligations, to spend the time at home as active as possible. See the current situation as an opportunity to complete some tasks you didn’t have time so far. Read a new book, watch an inspiring movie, tidy up a drawer in which you stored various papers for a long time. If you experience a feeling of discomfort or other symptoms that you may associate with current anti-epidemic measures, it is important to stay calm. Talk to your friends over the phone, especially those you know will have a calming effect on you, and you can also seek expert advice. The citizens of Serbia can also count on my professional help every night from 21:00 to 22:30."

It can often be heard that the employee had to give up the right to vacation, maternity leave etc. Also, the professor stated that the crisis due to COVID-19 will fundamentally shake labor relations, since a large number of working hours were lost during three and a half months, according to the ILO research. The manual pays special attention to working mothers and treats salaries and salary compensation, types of employment, working hours and absences etc. He also stated that 12,000 people lost their jobs during one month and that is an additional challenge to put the topic of labor law in focus."

      "p5": "In Serbia, only every fifth municipality or city has defined activities, in cooperation with local employers, aimed at helping families with small children, single parents or young married couples, which would enable them to better balance work and parenthood. However, local self-government units are very much considering such activities, because as many as 43 percent of the surveyed municipalities that are not currently engaged in strategic directions in this area, plan to be actively involved in the affirmation of parenthood, and find and implement solutions that facilitate coordination of work and private life. In that way, local self-governments would also support social goals, strategically set, and related to encouraging birth rates and improving the demographic picture of Serbia. However, many of the forms of assistance that are widely used in more developed countries have not yet taken root in our country, whether the obstacle is the lack of money in local budgets, or lack of initiative in municipal bodies and institutions, so any willingness to think in that direction is encouraging.",
      "p6": "These results were shown by the Research of local needs towards work-life balance conducted by the Ministry of Family Welfare and Demography, for the needs of the project Equal - Towards closing the gender gap in balancing professional and private lives of employees. On this occasion, we spoke with Gordana Bjelobrk, demographer and project coordinator.",
      "p7": "- Considering the fact that the local self-government is responsible for the quality of life of citizens on its territory and that it can best recognize the needs of parents, it is necessary to be actively involved in the burning problem related to rehabilitation of childbirth and parenthood. Therefore, it is necessary for the local self-government to act strategically with a clearly defined action plan, measures and activities that will ensure sustainable reproductive behavior of the population in the long run.",
      "p8": "Based on the results of the research, Bjelobrk continues, it can be concluded that flexible working hours, as one of the most used models of employer benefits in the world, are still not sufficiently represented in our country.",
      "p9": "- Most municipalities are not ready to make additional efforts in the coming period and see how important it would be for employed parents to have different options for flexible work engagement, which is increasingly becoming a future of modern and socially responsible behavior of employers themselves. Flexible working hours are an example of good practice in countries that have achieved success in the field of work-life balance. Responsible employers are increasingly aware of the fact that some form of flexible working hours has a positive impact on employees’ productivity and directly affects better business results. In Serbia, only 13.5 percent of municipalities provide flexible working hours as one of the forms of work for employed parents with preschool and younger school children. Most municipalities do not provide flexible working hours, but half of them are ready to provide this type of flexible work engagement in the future, if the work process allows it, explains Bjelobrk.",
      "p10": "However, the redistribution of working hours (different number of working hours per day during one working week) is present in only 16.2 percent of municipalities. Most municipalities did not recognize this type of flexible work engagement, which includes the “work from home” option that was very prevalent during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "p11": "However, the redistribution of working hours (different number of working hours per day during one working week) is present in only 16.2 percent of municipalities. Most municipalities did not recognize this type of flexible work engagement, which includes the “work from home” option that was very prevalent during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "p12": "On the other hand, most municipalities, 78.4 percent of them, are aware of the need to provide all employees with institutional conditions for balancing work and parenthood and thus increase their productivity, which ultimately results in better business results of local self-government. Thus, municipalities and cities expressed their readiness to establish preschool institutions within the business environment or in the immediate vicinity of the company. However, it is obvious that finances are one of the key obstacles in achieving such goals, because most local self-government units would take such moves if they received state support.",
      "p13": "From less developed local self-governments with more modest budgets, which prevail in Serbia, generally not enough money is allocated for one-time types of financial support to families with children. Municipalities are the most generous when it comes to one-time financial assistance for the birth of a child, and it is provided by as many as 78.4 percent of local self-government units. Although every fifth municipality does not allocate funds for that, three quarters are ready to provide it in the future, while a quarter will not be able to afford it for their employees.",
      "p14": "However, when it comes to one-time financial assistance for a child's starting school, it is provided by only 16% of municipalities. Most municipalities, 84 percent, do not provide this type of financial assistance, but 71 percent of them are ready to work on it in the future.",
      "p15": "The most important type of support, reimbursement of costs for the health treatment of a child, is represented in about 76 percent of municipalities. Also, a large percentage are ready to direct a part of the budget funds to that type of assistance to parents in need in the future.",
      "p16": "As Bjelobrk explains, the research was organized with the aim of gathering information on the problems faced by local self-government units and employed parents considering work-life balance, but also information on local self-governments attitudes and their readiness and social responsibility towards the most important members of the social community through support to employed parents with small children.",
      "p17": "- Aware of all the negative demographic trends, the Government of the Republic of Serbia has made a decision to be more active in the field of population policy in order to create conditions for the gradual demographic recovery of the country. Therefore, in March 2018, the government adopted a strategic document aimed at encouraging birth rates with the general goal of sustainable demographic development of Serbia - stationary population, with the previous achievement of eight special goals, including work-life balance, preservation and improvement of reproductive health and activation of local self-government, says Bjelobrk.",
      "p18": "The research was conducted in October and November last year, and when selecting the framework of local self-government units, of which 37 were randomly selected for the survey, special care was taken to represent local self-governments of different levels of development from four regions of Serbia (Vojvodina, Belgrade, Sumadija and Western Serbia and the Region of Southern and Eastern Serbia).",

It is very important to change the opinion of employers that „everyone is replaceable“ if we want to progress as a healthy society, and especially when we talk about increasing the birth rate.",
        "p4": "* Commissioner for the Protection of Equality, from 2014 to 2018, received as many as 57 percent of complaints about discrimination on the labour market were filed by women. Mostly, discrimination was related to placement to lower job positions, termination of the employment contract after returning from maternity leave or leave from work due to child care, as well as age.",
        "date": "Belgrade, 9th April 2021.",
        "p5": "Work-life balance implies that a person gives equal priority to the demands of career and private life. Some of the most common reasons that lead to a work-life misbalance include increased responsibility at work, longer working hours, caring for children and other household members, increased work flexibility, extended working hours and reduced job security, that mostly affect women. Companies that gain a reputation for fostering work-life balance have become very attractive to workers and tend to have higher employee retention rates which results in shorter training time, increased loyalty and degree of internal expertise, says ",

The project is implemented by the Ana and Vlade Divac Foundation together with the Ministry of Family Welfare and Demography and it aims to facilitate the whole process of work-life balance for both employers and employees and try to find the best models for parents with small children, which will not affect their achievements in family life.",
        "p6": "- Commissioner for the Protection of Equality reports show that in the second place, in terms of the number of complaints, are those related to discrimination in the field of labour and employment. In the period from 2014 to 2018, complaints in the field of labour and employment were filed by women in 57.3 percent of cases. The reasons why women most often state gender component as the basis of discrimination considering employment and at workplace are: placement to lower job positions, termination of employment contracts after returning from maternity leave or leave from work due to child care, as well as age, Jovanovic points out.",
        "p7": "The research, conducted by the Ministry of Family Welfare and Demography for the purpose of determining the attitudes of companies on balancing work processes and family obligations of employees, also collected information on how much the sick leave of employed parents due to child care affects the employer's business results.",
        "p8": "- Every other employer (55.5 percent) believes that the length of maternity leave is not a problem for the employer, while 44 percent of employers recognized maternity leave as a challenge they have to face and find a way to reorganize work processes. None of the employers believe that maternity leave for working mothers can seriously jeopardize the production process and that it represents a serious problem for them, according to the results of the research done by Jovanović.",
        "b1": " according to the results of the research done by Jovanovic.",
        "p9": "However, frequent sick leave for child care is a bigger challenge for employers. Certainly, employers who have a larger number of employed women in the reproductive period (from 15 to 49 years) are more often faced with this problem, and that for 51.8 percent of employers frequent absences still represent a problem in the organization of work. One in three employers (33.4 percent) said that frequent sick leave is not a problem for achieving the company's business results, the research showed.",
        "p10": "- That is why we made a Manual for employers in order to help them to make better organization of work in the future and to learn about the affirmative measures that the law secures when it comes to employment. It is very important to change the opinion of employers that „everyone is replaceable“ if we want to progress as a healthy society, and especially when we talk about increasing the birth rate. The position of the majority of employers, 78 percent of them, is that parents obviously contribute to the success of the company, so the recommendation would be to listen to their employees when their needs are in question, ",

        "p11": "She points out that it is very important for the employer to know and understand the needs of his employees, as well as to set a positive example.",
        "p12": "- If, for example, you send emails at any time of the day or night or work on weekends, your employees will think that they are expected to do the same, and it is very important to respect the agreed working hours of the employees so they can have time for themselves and their families. Employees who achieve balance in life feel more motivated and less stressed at work, which increases the company's productivity and reduces the number of conflicts between colleagues and management, explains Jovanovic. Companies that want to positively affect employee satisfaction and thus their greater productivity and job satisfaction, can achieve that through: prioritizing a healthy culture and reducing stress, offering flexible working hours, comfortable office conditions, opportunities for advancement and good management that understands the needs of its employees."

Iznenađujuće, prepreke tome nisu uvek samo finansijske, sudeći po odgovorima JLS, ali se ipak najveći deo opština i gradova izjasnio da bi u bilo kakve poduhvate te vrste, ušao najpre uz pomoć države i njenih institucija.",

Studies have shown that employees who have positive work-life balance are better at their jobs, so promoting this balance is beneficial for both individuals and for the company.

The author of the manual is PhD Bojan Urdarevic, professor of Labor Law at the Faculty of Law in Kragujevac and conciliator at the Republic Agency for Peaceful Settlement of Labor Disputes.",

    "date": "Belgrade, 25th March 2021.",
    "p1": "* Flexible working hours are very necessary considering the fact that 91 percent of women and 81 percent of men would give an advantage to a company that provides employees with some of its forms, when choosing a new job",
    "p2": "* About 40 percent of employed parents would prefer to have flexible working hours, 35 percent of them would like to be able to choose shifts, 27 percent see the redistribution of working hours as more useful, and 33 percent preferred work from home.",
    "p3": "* Only 13.5 percent of municipal administrations apply flexible working hours, while 16.2 percent allow redistribution of working hours, and local governments are not ready to make additional efforts in the future and take into account how important it would be for employed parents to have different options for flexible work engagement, which is increasingly becoming the feature of modern and socially responsible behaviour of employers.",
    "p4": "In the modern business world, flexible working hours are recognizable category of work organization. Responsible employers are increasingly aware of the fact that if they apply some form of flexible organization of obligations at work has a positive impact on employee productivity and directly affects better business results, so both parties benefit from it. The organization of work outside the strictly limited working hours and the possibility to balance obligations more efficiently is especially important for employed parents with small children. The need for flexible organization is also shown by the research data, as many as 88 percent of employed parents would take into account the fact whether the employer offers such an option when accepting a new job. However, despite the awareness of the advantages of flexible working hours, redistribution of working hours or work from home, local self-governments in Serbia provide such opportunities to their employees in a very small percentage. We are talking with demographer Gordana Bjelobrk, coordinator of the project 'Equal - Towards closing the gender gap in balancing professional and private lives of employees', about the attitudes of parents and about the current situation and plans for adjusting the work process in local self-government units as an employer. The project is being implemented by the Ministry of Family Welfare and Demography, in cooperation with Ana and Vlade Divac Foundation, and the data we present in this article are the result of The research on work-life balance.",
    "subHeading": "Attitudes of working parents",
    "p5": "According to the results of the research, the largest number of respondents, employed parents with small children (78.5 percent) believe that flexible working hours significantly contribute to better work-life balance, and achieving the maximum in all fields of life and work. As much as 40 percent of the surveyed employees gave priority to this flexible form of organization.",
    "p6": "- Respondents stated that such organization of working hours suits them because they can leave work earlier and dedicate themselves to their children and families, and also organize the care of children or elderly family members. Also, flexible working hours are very suitable for organizing daily routine ie to pick up children from kindergarten or school, especially if both parents can use that form of working hours, states Bjelobrk.",
    "p7": "On the other hand, 26.8 percent of the surveyed parents believe that the redistribution of working hours, ie a different number of working hours distributed by days during the working week, would best contribute to a better organization of work and private obligations.",
    "p8": "- Work from home, as a form of redistribution of working hours, is relevant in the new situation with the pandemic, and is acceptable for every third respondent (33.1 percent). Some LSG employees work with clients and due to the nature of their work, they are unable to work from home. But, the advantages of working from home have certainly been recognized, such as more time spent with children, as well as organizing childcare to better fit in with business obligations, Bjelobrk points out. About 35 percent of employed parents put the possibility of choosing shifts in the first place. This possibility allows for a better division of labour between spouses and greater involvement of fathers in the child care, as well as to secure their presence during the growing up.",
    "p9": "- The very possibility that parents can optionally accept overtime work, implies the necessary active involvement of employers in considering the challenges of work-life balance, with the aim of finding mutual benefits. 28.5 percent of respondents chose this option as the most acceptable, says Bjelobrk.",
    "subHeading2": "Current practice and plans of local governments",
    "p10": "Negative demographic trends, which have been affecting Serbia for a long time, are the reason why the Government of the Republic of Serbia made the decision to act more actively in the field of population policy. In order to create conditions for the gradual demographic recovery of the country, special goals have been set, among which are work-life balance, but also the activation of local self-government. It is the response of municipalities and cities to such needs of employees, through the most direct contact between government officials and citizens in local communities, that is key to achieving success in finding the best solutions and achieving the desired results. The conducted research, therefore, aimed to find a reliable basis for defining new measures important for work-life balance of employees, which should then be implemented and established at the local level.",
    "p11": "However, part of the research related to the organization of the work process, which is presented in this article, showed that local self-government does not provide their employees with the opportunity to balance work and private life in a better and more efficient way, which especially affects families with small children.",
    "p12": "- Most municipalities are not ready to make additional efforts in the coming period and see how important it would be for employed parents to have different options for flexible work engagement, which is increasingly becoming a future of modern and socially responsible behaviour of employers, concludes Bjelobrk.",
    "p13": "The fact that only 13.5 percent of the surveyed local self-governments offer flexible working hours to employees is not encouraging either. However, 53.1 percent of them said that in the future they could organize the work process in that way.",
    "p14": "- Redistribution of working hours, and different number of working hours per day during one working week, is represented in only 16.2 percent of municipalities. Most municipal and city administrations did not recognize the benefits of this type of flexible employment. This includes working from home, a form of fulfilling business obligations that were very common during the pandemic caused by the Covid-19 virus. Less than half of the municipalities that do not currently provide this type of flexible working hours (41.9 percent) are ready to provide employed parents in the future to organize their work in that way, in order to more easily reconcile work and family obligations, according to Bjelobrk.",
    "p15": "Currently, the most common form of flexible working is the optional acceptance of overtime hours, which exists in 43.2 percent of local self-government units. Slightly more than half of the municipalities that have not given that opportunity to their employees so far is ready to enable parents with small children in the future to choose whether to accept overtime work.",
    "subHeading3": "Women welcome any opportunity to balance commitments",
    "p16": "- Employees in municipal and city administrations throughout Serbia almost unanimously agree (in 98 percent of cases) that parents of children of preschool and younger school age should have special benefits that will enable them to achieve work-life balance. The fact that flexible working hours are very necessary is illustrated by the result that 91 percent of women and 81 percent of men would give an advantage to a company that provides employees with some of its forms when choosing a new job. The dominant structure in favour of women in almost all surveyed local governments points to the conclusion that it is very important for women to have every opportunity to more easily organize professional and family obligations, explains Bjelobrk."
